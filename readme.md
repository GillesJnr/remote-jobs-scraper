This is a project to develop a scraper for scraping Larajobs, getting new remote job postings,
calculating a rough estimate of how fit one is for the jobs and a list of possible emails to
send an application to.

Further work will involve building an interactive CLI program that automatically sends a template
message together with your CV to an email picked by you as application email while browsing through
unapplied jobs from the local sqlite db.

Also updates will be made to capture mentions of required years of experience in job postings to take
that into consideration.
